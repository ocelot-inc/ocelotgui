Ocelot ocelotgui

<P>Version 0.9.0</P>

<P>The Ocelot GUI (ocelotgui), a database client, allows users to connect to
a MySQL or MariaDB DBMS server, enter SQL statements, and receive results.
Some of its features are: syntax highlighting, user-settable colors
and fonts for each part of the screen, result-set displays
with multi-line rows and resizable columns, and a debugger.</P>

<H3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</H3><HR>

<P>The basic prerequisites for installation are Linux, and the Qt library.
The libmysqlclient library will also be necessary, at runtime.</P>

<H3 id="getting-the-qt-library">Getting the Qt library</H3><HR>

<P>You probably will find that the Qt package is already installed,
since other common packages depend on it. If not, your Linux
distro's repositories will provide a Qt package.
For example, on some platforms you can say
"sudo apt-get install libqt5core5a" to install Qt5.</P>

<P>You will need to know the version of the Qt library.
It can be found with find /usr/lib -name "libQt*Gui.so*", or find /usr/lib64 -name "libQt*Gui.so*".
If the response starts with libQtGui.so.4 then you have Qt4,
if the response starts with libQt5Gui.so.5 then you have Qt5.
Alternatively it sometimes can be found with qmake -v.</P>

<P>The Qt library is necessary for ocelotgui installation.</P>

<H3 id="getting-the-libmysqlclientso-library">Getting the libmysqlclient.so library</H3><HR>

<P>You may find that the libmysqlclient.so library is already installed,
if you have used a MySQL or MariaDB client program before.
If not, your Linux distro's repositories will contain it,
usually with a name like "libmysqlclient-dev" or "libmysqlclient-devel".</P>
<P>A tip for Mageia 5: You can use "urpmf <library name>" to find
what packages contain libmysqlclient.so.
If the answer is lib64mariadb18, you can install it with:
sudo urpmi lib64mariadb18.</P>
<P>A tip for openSUSE 13.1: if neither Qt nor libmysqlclient libraries exist, say:
<PRE>
 sudo zypper install libqt4-devel
 sudo zypper install mariadb-client
 sudo zypper install libmysqlclient-devel</PRE>
<P>The important file is named "libmysqlclient.so".
If it is not already on the default path, then an error or warning
will appear when you try to run ocelotgui. Find it, and say something like</P>
<PRE>export LD_RUN_PATH=[path to directory that contains libmysqlclient.so]</PRE>
Several other directories are searched; for details start ocelotgui
after installation and choose Help | libmysqlclient.</P>

<P>The libmysqlclient library is not necessary for ocelotgui installation;
however, it is necessary at runtime in order to connect to a database server.</P>

<H3 id="getting-the-ocelotgui-executable-package">Getting the ocelotgui executable package</H3><HR>

There are ocelotgui binary packages for platforms such as Ubuntu where "Debian-like" packages
are preferred, or platforms such as Mageia/SUSE/Fedora where "RPM-like" packages
are preferred.
If one of the following ocelotgui binary packages is compatible with your platform,
cut and paste the corresponding pair of instructions onto your computer and
you can be up and running in about 15 seconds.<BR><BR>

</P>

<H3 id="getting-and-using-the-ocelotgui-source">Getting and using the ocelotgui source</H3><HR>

<P>The ocelotgui source package has everything necessary to compile
and link and install for any Linux distribution. If the typical
developer packages such as cmake and the gcc c/c++ compiler has
been installed already, building an executable usually takes
less than fifteen minutes.</P>

<P>The official location of the project is on github: <A HREF="https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui">https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui</A>.
This is where the latest source files are. This is what can be "cloned".
Typically, to get it, one would install git, cd to a download directory, then</P>
<PRE>
git clone https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui
</PRE>
<P>A clone has the latest source, but not executables.
A clone may contain patches which are not yet part of a release.
Ordinarily users are advised to use a release rather than a clone,
until they have used ocelotgui for a while.</P>

<P>The releases for ocelot-inc/ocelotgui are also on github:
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/releases">https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/releases</A>.
A release includes the source files as of the release time.
Although the release does not have the "latest" source which is
in ocelot-inc/ocelotgui, it usually is more stable.
A release file is highlighted in green
by github and is named ocelotgui-[version].tar.gz. Thus release 0.9.0 is at
https://github.com/ocelotgui/releases/download/0.9.0/ocelotgui-0.9.0.tar.gz.
Typically, to get it, one would cd to a download directory, then
<PRE>
wget https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/releases/download/0.9.0/ocelotgui-0.9.0.tar.gz
</PRE>
or use a browser to go to <A HREF="https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/releases">https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/releases</A>
and click ocelotgui-0.9.0.tar.gz.</P>

<P>A tip for SUSE 42.1: do the following install instructions in advance.
If the packages alread exist, then there will be harmless error messages.<BR>
 sudo zypper install git<BR>
 sudo zypper install gcc<BR>
 sudo zypper install gcc-c++<BR>
 sudo zypper install make
</P>

<P>A tip for Ubuntu 15.04:<PRE>
 #Get Qt libraries. The message "already installed" might appear.
 sudo apt-get install qt5-default qtbase5-dev qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools</PRE></P>

<P>Unpack all the source files by saying:<PRE>
 tar -zxvf ocelotgui-0.9.0.tar.gz
 cd ocelotgui</PRE>
At this point it is a good idea to examine the file CMakeLists.txt.
This file has comments about options which are available to
customize the build process: CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX,
MYSQL_INCLUDE_DIR, WITH_QT4.
For explanation of these flags, read the comments
in the CMakeLists.txt file.
If no customizing is necessary,
the typical build process is:<PRE>
 make clean        # unnecessary the first time
 rm CMakeCache.txt # unnecessary the first time
 cmake .
 make
 sudo make install</PRE>
The above instructions will usually put the ocelotgui program and
directories in subdirectories of /usr/local, so if /usr/local/bin
is on your PATH then after this saying ocelotgui will start the program.
However, it is often better to make and install a package,
which will cause a few additional steps to be performed, such as
registering so that the ocelotgui can be started from the launcher.
For Debian-like platforms say:<PRE>
 cmake . -DCPACK_GENERATOR="DEB"
 make
 cpack
 sudo dpkg -i ocelotgui_0.9.0-1_i386.deb</PRE>
For RPM-like platforms say:<PRE>
 cmake . -DCPACK_GENERATOR="RPM"
 make
 cpack
 sudo rpm -i ocelotgui-0.9.0-1.x86_64.rpm</PRE>
Usually the result will go to subdirectories of /usr, in which case,
if /usr/bin is on your PATH, then saying ocelotgui will start the program.
</P>

<P>Some other facts about the source package, for users who
like to explore code ...
files with the extension *.png
or *.htm or *.md or *.txt or *.jpg are for documentation, the file
LICENSE.GPL is for legal requirements, ocelotgui-qt4 and
ocelotgui-qt5 are executable copies of the program, and
files with the extension *.cpp or *.pro or *.h are source code.
The main() code is in ocelotgui.cpp. All the source code has
comments. Since ocelotgui is a Qt-using program, it is also
possible to use Qt Creator as an IDE editor/compiler and qmake
to build -- the file ocelotgui.pro exists for this purpose,
and the comments at the end of ocelotgui.pro have more explanation.
For example, on Ubuntu 14.04, if the intent is to rebuild for Qt 4 from source,
these instructions have been known to work:
<PRE>
 sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake
 sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev
 cd [path to ocelotgui source files]
 make clean
 /usr/bin/qmake-qt4 -config release
 make</PRE>
For more commentary about compiling and building,
read an ocelotgui.cpp comment that begins with the words
"General comments".
</P>


<H3 id="starting-the-program">Starting the program</H3><HR>

<P>After installing and making sure that ocelotgui is on the
path, start it with<PRE>
ocelotgui</PRE>
or use options, for example<PRE>
/ocelotgui-qt4 --host=127.0.0.1 --user=joe --password=secret</PRE>
-- if the program starts, and menu items such as Help|Manual
work, then installation is successful.
Stop again with File|Exit or control-Q.
</P>

<P>Warning: Some menu shortcut keys may not work properly with Ubuntu 14.04.</P>

<H3 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</H3><HR>

<P>The ocelotgui application, more fully
'The Ocelot Graphical User Interface', allows users to connect to
a MySQL or MariaDB DBMS server, enter SQL statements, and receive results.
Some of its features are: syntax highlighting, user-settable colors
and fonts for each part of the screen, and result-set displays
with multi-line rows and resizable columns, and a debugger.</P>

<H3 id="the-company-the-product-and-the-status">The company, the product, and the status</H3><HR>

<P>Ocelot Computer Services is a Canadian company
which has specialized in database products for thirty years.
Its main employees worked for MySQL AB and
Sun Microsystems and Oracle between 2003 and 2011.</P>
  
<P>The ocelotgui program is a front end which connects to MySQL (tm) or MariaDB (tm).
In some ways it is like the basic mysql client program,
with added GUI features: full-screen editing, syntax
highlighting, tabular display, customized fonts and colors.
It differs from some other front-end GUI products because
it is open source (GPL), it is written in C++, and it makes use
of the Qt multi-platform widget library.</P>
  
<P>The product status is: beta. It has been known to work as described in
this manual on several Linux distros. It is stable, in the sense that
there are no known severe errors and the features are frozen until the
version 1.0 release, which is planned for May 2016.
Ocelot will address any bug reports and will answer any questions.</P>

<H3 id="downloading-installing-and-building">Downloading, installing, and building</H3><HR>

<P>To download the product go to
<A HREF="https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui">https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui</A>.
Instructions for installation will be in the README.md file.
This location may change, or alternate locations may appear.
If so there will either be an announcement on github or on ocelot.ca.</P>
 
<P>The package contains source code, and
two executable files, one for use with Qt version 4 and the
other for use with Qt version 5.
The executables are built dynamically.
They look for pre-installed copies of Qt libraries and of the
MySQL client library -- see the README.md file about these.
The executables were built with Ubuntu 12.04 and may not work
well on other Linux distros -- if that is the case, consult
the README.md and the source code to see how to build from
source.</P>
 
<H3 id="starting">Starting</H3><HR>

<P>
There must be an instance of MySQL or MariaDB running somewhere.  
</P>
<P>
If connection is possible with the mysql client and does not require
unusual options, then connection is possible with ocelotgui. If there is
a my.cnf file, ocelotgui will read it, just as the mysql client would.
If there are connection-related options on the command line, ocelotgui
will accept them just as the mysql client would. Therefore the typical
way to start the program is to say  
ocelotgui [--option [--option...]]  
For a description of options see <A HREF="https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/blob/master/options.txt">https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/blob/master/options.txt</A>.
</P>
<P>
<A href="starting-dialog"><img src="starting-dialog.png" alt="starting-dialog.png" align="right" height="128"></A>
If a password is required but not supplied, a dialog box will appear.
Or, if the initial attempt to connect fails, an error message will appear
saying it is necessary to choose File|Connect, which will cause the dialog
box to appear. The dialog box has many possible settings
(see the list in <A HREF="https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/blob/master/options.txt">https://github.com/ocelot-inc/ocelotgui/blob/master/options.txt</A>);
however, for getting started, the ones that matter most are the ones
at the top: host, port, user, socket, password, protocol.  
If the connection still fails, then ocelotgui will still come up,
but only non-DBMS tasks such as screen customizing will be possible.
<BR clear="all">
</P>
<P>
<A href="starting"><img src="starting.png" alt="starting.png" align="right" height="256"></A>
In any case, an initial screen will appear. After some activity has
taken place, the screen will have four parts, from top to bottom:<BR>
menu <BR>
history widget, where retired statements and diagnostics end up <BR>
results widget, where SELECT result sets appear <BR>
statement widget, where users can type in instructions.<BR>
Initially, though, only the menu and statement widget will appear.
</P>
<P>
Again, this should be reminiscent of the way the mysql client works:
statements are typed at the bottom of the screen, and appear to
scroll off the top after they are executed, with results in the middle.  
</P>
 
<H3 id="statement-widget">Statement widget</H3><HR>

<P>The statement widget is an editable multi-line text box.
The usual control keys that work on other text editors will work
here too; see the later description of Menu Item: Edit.</P>
  
<P>The program includes a syntax checker and can recognize the parts of
speech in MySQL grammar.
It will do syntax highlighting
by changing the color, for example comments will appear in light green,
identifiers in green, operators in dark gray, and so on.  
The colors can be
customized, see the later description of Menu Item: Settings.</P>
<P>
The left side of the statement widget is reserved for the prompt,
and cannot be typed over. Initially the prompt will be 'mysql&gt;'
but this can be changed, see the later description of
Client Statements: Prompt.  
</P>
<P>
<A href="statement-widget-example"><img src="statement-widget-example.png" alt="statement-widget-example.png" align="right" height="82"></A>
For example, this screenshot shows the statement widget
after the user has changed the default prompt and
entered an SQL statement.
The statement has keywords in magenta, literals in dark green,
operators in light green, and comments in red.
The prompt on the left has a gray background.
<BR clear="all"> 
</P>

<P>Major Feature Alert: this is not merely a GUI that only will
highlight words that are in a list of keywords.
This GUI will parse the complete MySQL or MariaDB grammar,
without needing to ask the server. So the highlighting
will be correct, syntax errors will be underlined in red,
and -- since the parsing method is predictive -- there will be
continuous hints about what word is expected next, and
optionally an error message explaining suspected syntax problems
before they to to the server.</P>

<P>Once a statement has been entered and is ready to be executed,
the user can hit control-E, choose menu item Run|Execute, or
place the cursor at the end of the text (after the ';' or other
delimiter) and type Enter. It is legal to enter multiple
statements, separated by semicolons, and then execute them
in a single sequence.</P>

<H3 id="client-statements">Client statements</H3><HR>

<P>A client statement is a statement which changes some behavior
of the client (that is, of the ocelotgui front end) but does not
necessarily go to the MySQL/MariaDB server. Of the statements
that the MySQL Reference manual describes in section
'mysql commands' <A HREF="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-commands.html">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/mysql-commands.html</A>
the ocelotgui program has working equivalents for: clear, delimiter, exit,
prompt, source, tee, and warnings. For example, entering 'quit;'
followed by Enter will cause the program to stop. It is
sometimes not mandatory to end a client statement with ';',
but is strongly recommended.</P>

<P>There are some enhancements affecting the PROMPT statement.
The special sequence '&#92;2' means 'repeat the prompt on all lines',
and the special sequence '&#92;L' means 'show line numbers'. For example,
'PROMPT &#92;2&#92;Lmariadb;' will change the prompt so that each line begins
with '[line number] mariadb>'.</P>

<H3 id="history-widget">History widget</H3><HR>

<P>Once a statement has been executed, a copy of the statement text
and the diagnostic result (for example: 0.04 seconds, OK) will
be placed in the history widget. Everything in the history widget
is editable including the prompt, and it simply fills up so that
after a while the older statements are scrolled off the screen.  
Thus its main function is to show what recent statements and
results were. Statements in the history can be retrieved while
the focus is on the statement widget, by selecting 'Previous statement'
or 'Next statement' menu items.</P>
<P>Initially the history widget will show some statements from past
sessions which are stored in a history file.</P>

<H3 id="result-widget">Result widget</H3><HR>

<P>
If a statement is SELECT or SHOW or some other statement that
returns a result set, it will appear in the result widget in
the middle area of the screen. The result widget is split up
into columns. Each column has a header and details taken from
what the DBMS returns.  
</P>
<P>
The width of the column depends on the result set's definition,
but extremely wide columns will be split onto multiple lines.
That is, one result-set row may take up to five lines.  
If the data still is too wide or too tall to fit in the cell,
then the cell will get a vertical scroll bar. The user can
change the width of a column by dragging the column's right
border to the right to make the column wider, or to the left
to make it narrower.  
</P>
<P>
The result widget as a whole may have a horizontal and a vertical
scroll bar. The vertical scroll bar moves a row at a time rather
than a pixel at a time -- this makes large result sets more
manageable, but makes the vertical scroll bar unresponsive if
each row has multiple lines and the number of rows is small.  
</P>
<P>
For example, this screenshot shows the whole screen after the
user has typed the statement "select * from information_schema.tables;"
on the statement widget and then executed it. The statement text
has been copied to the history widget, the statement widget has
been cleared, the result widget has the rows. The user has
dragged the border of the fourth column to the left, causing
a scroll bar to appear.

Settings|Menu, Settings|History Widget, Settings|Grid Widget,
Settings|Statement, and Settings|Extra Rule 1 are
items which affect the behavior of each
individual widget. The color settings affect foregrounds,
backgrounds, borders, and (for the statement widget only)
the syntax highlights. The font settings affect font family,
boldness, italics, and size. Font settings
involve further dialog boxes which are standard with Qt.
There may be additional choices affecting appearance,
for example the width of the border used to drag columns

Settings|Extra Rule 1 is conditional -- for example, to specify
that BLOBs should be displayed as images on a pink background,
set Grid Background Color Pink, set Condition = data_type LIKE
'%BLOB', set Display As = image, then click OK.

Options|detach history widget,
Options|detach result grid widget,
Options|detach debug widget are
for turning the respective widgets into independent windows,
so that they can be moved away from the statement widget,
or resized. A detached widget is always kept on top of the
other widgets in the application screen. When a widget is
already detached, the menu item text will change to "attached"
and clicking it will put the widget back in its original position.

It is possible to debug stored procedures and functions.  
This version of ocelotgui incorporates MDBug
(read about MDBug at <A HREF="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~hp-mdbug-team/mdbug/trunk/view/head:/debugger.txt">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~hp-mdbug-team/mdbug/trunk/view/head:/debugger.txt</A>).  
All debugger instructions can be entered on the ocelotgui command line;  
some operations can also be done via the Debug menu or by clicking on the stored-procedure display.  
Currently-supported instructions are:  <BR>
$install -- this is always the first thing to do.  <BR>
$setup routine_name [, routine_name ...] -- prepares so '$debug routine_name' is possible.  <BR>
$debug routine_name -- starts a debug session, shows routines in a tabbed widget.  <BR>
$breakpoint routine_name line_number or Debug|breakpoint -- sets a breakpoint.  <BR>
$clear routine_name line_number -- clears a breakpoint.  <BR>
$next or Debug|Next -- goes to next executable line, without dropping into subroutines.  <BR>
$step or Debug|Step -- goes to next executable line, will drop into subroutines.  <BR>
$continue or Debug|Continue -- executes until breakpoint or until end of procedure.  <BR>
$refresh breakpoints -- refreshes xxxmdbug.breakpoints table.  <BR>
$refresh server_variables -- refreshes xxxmdbug.server_variables table.  <BR>
$refresh variables -- refreshes xxxmdbug.variables table.  <BR>
$refresh user_variables -- refreshes xxxmdbug.user_variables table.  <BR>
$exit or Debug|Exit -- stops a debug session.  <BR>
<BR clear="all">

<A href="special-vertical"><img src="special-vertical.png" alt="special-vertical.png" align="right" height="256"></A>
Vertical: If a user starts the program with ocelotgui --vertical=1
or ends a statement with backslash G, results come up with one column per row.  
<BR clear="all"> 
</P>
  
<P>
<A href="special-images"><img src="special-images.png" alt="special-images.png" align="right" height="256"></A>
Images: If a user chooses Settings | Extra Rule 1 from the menu,
and sets the Condition and Display As boxes as described earlier,
and selects rows which contain LONGBLOB columns, and the column values are
images (such as PNG or JPEG or BMP or GIF format data), ocelotgui will display
the result as images.  
<BR clear="all">
</P>
<P>
Result-set editing: If a user clicks on a column in the result set
and makes a change, an update statement will appear in the statement widget.
For example, if a result set is the result from SELECT column1, column2 FROM t;,
and the column1 value is 5, and the column2 value is 'ABC', and the user changes
the column2 value to 'AB', then the
statement widget will show UPDATE t SET column2 = 'AB' WHERE column1 = 5 AND column2 = 'AB';.
The user then has the choice of ignoring the update statement or executing it.  
</P>
<P>
<A href="special-detach"><img src="special-detach.png" alt="special-detach.png" align="right" height="256"></A>
Detaching: If a user chooses Options | detach history widget or
Options | detach result grid widget, then the widget will become a separate window
which can be moved or resized.  
<BR clear="all">
</P>
<P>
<A href="special-settings"><img src="special-settings.png" alt="special-settings.png" align="right" height="512"></A>
Colors: The Colors and fonts dialog boxes have a simple way to choose
colors, by selecting from a choice of 148 color names / color icons. Users can also
change colors by saying SET object_name_color = color-name | hex-rgb-value.  
In fact ocelotgui mixes the modes: for example if a user chooses Settings | Grid Text Color,
then clicks on the 'Red' icon, then clicks OK, ocelotgui generates a
statement "SET ocelot_grid_text_color = 'Red'". This makes the instruction
easy to repeat or put in a script.
<BR clear="all">
</P>

<P>RE: SQL_MODE. To distinguish between literals and identifiers enclosed
in double quotes, ocelotgui needs to know the value of sql_mode (ansi_quotes).
It calculates this automatically; however, in rare circumstances it can
fail to detect changes on the server. If that appears to be the case, say
SET SESSION SQL_MODE = @@SESSION.SQL_MODE; to update it.</P>

<P>RE: TAB COMPLETION. While a user is entering an SQL statement,
ocelotgui will display a list of possible words that may follow.
Hitting the Tab key will cause the first word in the list to be
displayed and accepted.</P>

<P>RE: HINTING FOR COLUMN NAMES. Although hints for syntax appear by
default, hints for table / column identifiers do not. In order to
make identifiers appear on the hint list: (1) ensure the setting
for auto_rehash has not been turned off; (2) enter the statement
"REHASH;" to make the client ask the server for a list of identifiers
in the current database; (3) when entering an SQL statement, type `
(backtick) at the point where an identifier is expected.</P>

<P>RE: FONT. By default, ocelotgui uses whatever font was in use
at the time it started. This may be a bad choice. We strongly
recommend switching to a fixed-pitch (mono) font, especially for
the result-set displays, otherwise screen space is wasted.</P>

<P>RE: PERMANENT CUSTOMIZING. Changes to settings can be done
with the Settings menu items, but such changes are not permanent.
So note the commands that ocelotgui performs when settings are
changed, and paste them into a file. Later this file can be
executed (for example with SOURCE file-name), whenever ocelotgui
is started again. Alternatively, settings can be placed in my.cnf.</P>

<P>RE: DEBUGGING WITH MYSQL 5.7. Oracle has made a significant
incompatible behavior change in version 5.7, which affects the
debugger. The current workaround is to say
"set global show_compatibility_56=on;". We expect to have a
more permanent fix for this problem in a forthcoming ocelotgui
version.</P>

<P>RE: CONNECTION DIALOG. As stated earlier, if a password is necessary
to connect, it is sufficient to start ocelotgui with "--password=<i>password</i>"
or by choosing File|Connect and typing a password in the Password
field (the sixth field in the Connection Dialog Box). Also on the
Connection Dialog Box, if the server is running on the same computer
as the ocelotgui client, it is sometimes a good idea to enter
'127.0.0.1' in the host field, instead of 'localhost'.</P>

<P>RE: ROW NUMBERS. Ocelot will replace the value 'row_number() over ()'
with the row number within the result set. For example, try<br>
SELECT 'row_number() over ()' as r, table_name.* FROM table_name;<br>
To disable this feature, start ocelotgui with --ocelot_client_side_functions=0.</P>

More Chart Options
------------------

It is now possible to get more chart (bars / lines /pies) options
inside ocelotgui. This is only in the github source code, not the
releases. Anyone who wans to see it can build ocelotgui from source
with a new cmake option, which so far has been tested on Linux only.

Build
-----

One must bring in the Qwt library. For a description of it see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwt
... the library is available on many Linux distros,
so just google for how to install on [your favourite].
The only version that has been tested so far is 6.1.4 with Qt5,
but there is no reason to expect that slight version change will cause a problem.

The source code which has the feature is inside #if (OCELOT_QWT_INCLUDE = 1 ... #endif,
and this is not the default, so either:
one says cmake . -DOCELOT_QWT_INCLUDE=1 then make
or
one changes the relevant line in the ocelotgui.h source file to say #define OCELOT_QWT_INCLUDE 1
... other than that, the instructions for building are as described for
ocelotgui 2.0.0 in the README file.

SET ocelot_grid_chart=
----------------------

There is a new client-side statement
SET ocelot_grid_chart = 'literal' [WHERE clause];
After you've typed SET ocelot_grid_chart= the prompt/autocomplete list wil be
'BAR'
'LINE'
'PIE'
'BAR VERTICAL'
'BAR STACKED'
'BAR VERTICAL STACKED'
'BAR SUBGROUP BY VALUE % 3'
'PIE SUBGROUP BY VALUE % 3'
'BAR SUBGROUP BY LEFT(COLUMN_NAME, 2)'
'LINE SUBGROUP BY LEFT(COLUMN_NAME, 2)'
'PIE SUBGROUP BY LEFT(COLUMN_NAME, 2)'
[string]
and you can make your own combination for example
SET ocelot_grid_chart = 'BAR STACKED' SUBGROUP BY VALUE % 5';

The optional WHERE may include COLUMN_NAME | COLUMN_NUMBER | COLUMN_TYPE
(relational operator) (literal value), along with AND|OR, as is usual for
any client-side SET OCELOT_GRID_... statements. For example
SET OCELOT_GRID_chart = 'PIE' WHERE column_name < 'k';

SET ocelot_grid_chart=''; will cancel all previous uses of SET ocelot_chart_grid,
that is, it turns the feature off.

Shortcut key combinations
-------------------------

Alt+Shift+B causes SET ocelot_grid_chart='bar';
Alt+Shift+L causes SET ocelot_grid_chart='line';
Alt_Shift+P causes SET ocelot_grid_chart='pie';
Alt+Shift+N causes SET ocelot_grid_chart='';

Alt+Shift+B, Alt_Shift_L, Alt_Shift+P will also produce
bar and line and pie charts in classic ocelotgui version 2.0.0,
without the Qwt library.

As usual, it is possible to change the key combinations with
SET ocelot_shortcut... statements.

Groups
------

Charts make sense when representing numbers.
A "group" is any uninterrupted series of numbers in a result-set row.
For example, in
SELECT 'a',1,2,3.7,4,'b',5e1,6,'c';
the first group is 1,2,3.7,4 and the second group is 5e1,6.
(That is the default. to change the default, use a WHERE clause.)

Subgroups
---------

A group may be divided into subgroups.
Subgrouping is what decides how sampling is done within a group.
Different methods of subgrouping are appropriate for different
types of chart.

There is automatic subgrouping of pies because otherwise all
pie segments would have a single colour.
(Different subgroups have different colours.)

There is automatic subgrouping of lines because otherwise the
points of all lines would be in the same axis and there would
be no apparent movement. The automatic subgrouping in this case
is SUBGROUP BY LEFT(COLUMN_NAME,2) so it need not be specified.

Effects of other settings
-------------------------

SET ocelot_grid_font=... affects what font the chart captions have.
SET ocelot_grid_cell_border_size=... affects the width of lines.
And other ocelot_grid settings affect what

Pictures showing effects will be in a soon-to-appear blog post.

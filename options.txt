Some details about ocelotgui options.

An option is a named value which affects connecting and behavior.
Most [ocelot] options are very similar to options of the mysql client.

The places that an option might be specified are:
within the program for example the default port value is 3306,
in an environment variable for example "export MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3306",
in a configuration file for example "port=3306" in $HOME/.my.cnf,
on the command line for example "./ocelotgui --port=3306",
or on the File|Connect dialog box.

Environment Variables

The ocelotgui program will look at these variables:
HOME, LD_RUN_PATH, MYSQL_GROUP_SUFFIX, MYSQL_HISTFILE,
MYSQL_HISTIGNORE, MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_PS1, MYSQL_PWD.
MYSQL_TCP_PORT, MYSQL_UNIX_PORT, MYSQL_TEST_LOGIN_FILE.

Option Files

The ocelotgui program will look in these option files:
/etc/my.cnf, /etc/mysql/my.cnf, [SYSCONFDIR]/my.cnf,
[defaults-extra-file], $HOME/.my.cnf, $HOME/.mylogin.cnf.
Within option files, the ocelotgui program will look
in these groups: [client] [mysql] [ocelot], as well
as groups specified by MYSQL_GROUP_SUFFIX.
On Windows, the order is different: %system, %windir,
[application-directory], %MYSQL_HOME%, [defaults-extra-file].

Command Line

The ocelotgui program will look at command-line arguments
which are specified in short form such as "-p 3306", or
which are specified in long form such as "--port=3306".

Dialog Box

A dialog box will appear if the user enters a user statement
"CONNECT;" or if the user chooses menu item File|Connect.
The user will be advised to do this at startup time if an
initial attempt to connect fails.

Example

The default value for "port" is 3306, this is
hard coded in the ocelotgui source.
The environment variable value for "port" is 3307, this is
set by "export MYSQL_TCP_PORT=3307" before starting ocelotgui.
The option file value for "port" is 3308, this is
set by putting "PORT=3308" in the [mysql] group in
the $HOME/.mysql.cnf file.
The command-line value for "port" is 3309, this is
set by putting "--port=3309" on the command line
when starting the ocelotgui program.
The dialog-box value for "port" is 3310, this is
set by choosing File|Connect, entering "3310" in
the widget labelled "Port", and clicking "OK".
The ocelotgui program reads the settings in the
above order, therefore the port number is 3310.



The Options

Options in the following list are in the same order that one sees
on the File|Connect dialog box: first come the 8 important connect
options (host, port, user, database, socket, password, protocol,
init_command), then all the other options in alphabetical order.
Unless otherwise stated, options are specifiable by saying
[option_name] = [value] in an option file or
--[option_name] = [value] on the command line
(sometimes --[option_name] alone is sufficient for true|false values),
or in the dialog box.
If an option value is irrelevant or invalid, the ocelotgui program
ignores it without displaying an error message.

host: Server address. Specifiable with MYSQL_HOST
environment variable, with host= in an option file, with
-h or --host on the command line, or in dialog box.
Example values: localhost 192.15.8.44 w@ww.com.
Warning: if host=localhost, ocelotgui tries to use a socket,
if this is not desirable then say localhost=127.0.0.1 instead.

port: Port that the server listens on, if the protocol is
TCP. Specifiable with
MYSQL_TCP_PORT environment variable, with port= in an option
file, with -P or --port on the command line, or in dialog box.
Example values: 3306 3307.

user: User name. Specifiable with user= in an option file,
with -u or --user on the command line, or in dialog box.
Example values: root guest jsmith.

database: Database name also known as schema name. Specifiable
with database= in an option file, with -D or --database on the
command line, or in dialog box. Example values: test account_data.

socket: Socket name that the server receives on, if the
protocol is SOCKET. Specifiable with socket= in an option file,
with -S or --socket= on the command line, or in dialog box.
Examples: var/lib/special.sock /home/user/x.sock.

password: Password associated with the user. Specifiable
with password= in an option file, with -p or --password= on
the command line, or in dialog box. If the password is
required but not specified, the dialog box will always appear.
Examples: sesame top_secret#1

protocol: How the connection to the server occurs. Possible
values are: blank or TCP or SOCKET. If host=localhost and
protocol is blank, then SOCKET is assumed. Specifiable with
protocol= in an option file, with --protocol= on the command
line, or in dialog box. Examples: tcp socket.

init_command: Initial statement that should be executed as
soon as connect is complete. Example: "select current_user()".

auto_rehash. If 1 (true), ocelotgui may try to
complete names.

auto_vertical_output. If 1 (true), ocelotgui will display
with one column per row.

batch. Mostly ignored, but if 1 (true), history is not written.

compress. If 1 (true), value is passed to the server.

sandbox mode if a password has expired at connect time.

connect_timeout. Ignored.

debug. Ignored.

debug_check. Ignored.

debug_info. Ignored.

defaults_group_suffix. Suffix that is added to the regular group
names for option files. For example, if defaults_group_suffix=_X,
then ocelotgui will look at options in groups client_X and mysql_X and
ocelot_X in addition to options in groups client and mysql and ocelot.

delimiter. What ends a statement, usually semicolon ";".

For example, if histignoreis "*select*", then statements
containing the string "select" will not be written.

will be based on HTML rather than on widgets, making results
look quite different. If one starts ocelotgui with --html --raw,
the actual html markup code will appear.

See also: the ocelot_ options which aren't related to Settings, below.

ocelot_client_side_functions: ocelot_client_side_functions=0 turns off
the client-side functions, such as "select row_number() over ...".
This may be unnecessary with newer versions of MariaDB.
The default is 1.

ocelot_dbms: --ocelot_dbms=x means assume the server DBMS is x
until connection is made. The possible values are 'mysql',
'mariadb', and 'tarantool'. The default is 'mysql'.

ocelot_grid_tabs: ocelot_grid_tabs=5
means assume that a stored procedure can return up to 5 result sets.
The default is 16.

ocelot_language: --ocelot_language='english' means the menu and the
client error messages should be in English, --ocelot_language='french'
means the menu and the client error messages should be in French.
The default is 'english'. 

ocelot_statement_syntax_checker: setting
ocelot_statement_syntax_checker=1 turns on the
syntax checker; setting ocelot_statement_syntax_checker=2
turns on the syntax checker and is insistent -- if ocelotgui
doesn't like the syntax checker, a confirmation dialog box
will appear. The default is 1.

ocelot_shortcut_connect, ocelotshortcut_exit, etc:
you can change what the shortcut is, for any menu
item, by specifying its name and a new keysequence.
For example: SET ocelot_shortcut_paste = 'Ctrl+Shift+K';

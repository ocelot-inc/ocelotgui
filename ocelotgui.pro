# Installing by rebuilding source, with Qt Creator
# Peter Gulutzan makes all packages with cmake as described in the README,
# and recommends that others do so.
# However, here are additional notes for users who are
# particularly interested in using Qt Creator instead.
# </P>
# <P>
# Important license notice: when downloading Qt Creator,
# you may be confronted with a "License Agreement" dialog box,
# remember that ocelotgui is licensed under GPL version 2,
# so we recommend picking LGPL and re-conveying as GPL.
# Do not accept any request to grant any additional rights
# to Qt's manufacturer.
# </P>
# <P>Make sure a C++ compiler such as g++ is installed first.</P>
# <P>Edit [path]/ocelotgui.pro: change INCLUDEPATH to a path
# that includes the file "mysql.h". It comes with MySQL or
# MariaDB developer packages, for example "sudo apt-get
# libmysqlclient-dev" will put it in directory /usr/include/mysql.<PRE>
#  #Edit [path]/ocelotgui.pro.
#  #Make sure that any of the lines that begins with "QMAKE_RPATHDIR + ..."
#  #points to where libmysqlclient.so really is now.
#  #It comes with MySQL or MariaDB,
#  #for example "sudo apt-get mysqlclient" will put it
#  #in file/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmysqlclient.so.
#  #Example:
#  #"QMAKE_RPATHDIR += /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql"
#  #Make sure that any of the lines that begins with "INCLUDEPATH+ ..."
#  #points to where mysql.h really is now. Example:
#  #"INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/mysql/include/mysql"
#  #(mysql.h comes with MySQL or MariaDB developer packages.
#  # For example "sudo apt-get libmysqlclient-dev" will
#  # put it in directory /usr/include/mysql).</PRE></P>
# <P>You will need to state a compiler for the kit.
# Steps for Qt Creator use are:<PRE>
#  Click File | Open File or Project ...
#  In "Open File" dialog box, in field "File name:", enter [path]/ocelotgui.pro
#  Click Next
#  Click Configure Project</PRE></P>
# <P>If you get a message "cannot find -lGL" when you
# try to run the project, try to install GL.
# With Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev.
# With Fedora: sudo yum install mesa-libGL-devel.</P>

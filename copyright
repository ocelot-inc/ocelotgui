Comment:
  The routine named debug_mdbug_install inside ocelotgui.cpp is taken and modified from
  https://launchpad.net/mdbug, specifically http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~hp-mdbug-team/mdbug/trunk/view/head:/install.sql,
  and therefore MDBug's maker's copyright and GPL version 2 license provisions
  are reproduced below. These provisions apply only for the
  part of the debug_mdbug_install routine which is marked within the program.
  The program as a whole is copyrighted by Peter Gulutzan and
  licensed under GPL version 2 as stated above.

  Linking MDBug statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on MDBug. Thus, the terms and
  conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.
  .
  In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of MDBug give you permission to combine MDBug with free
  software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard release
  of Eclipse under the Eclipse Public License version 1.0 (or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license).
  You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for MDBug and the licenses of the other
  code concerned, provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires
  distribution of source code.
  .
  Note that people who make modified versions of MDBug are not obligated to grant this special exception for their
  modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a
  modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
  carries forward this exception.
